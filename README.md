# Integrated Principal Components Analysis (iPCA)
iPCA is a generalization of the classicial Principal Components Analysis to the data integration setting, where we observe multiple datasets. This repository provides the code associated with Tiffany M. Tang, Genevera I. Allen "Integrated Principal Components Analysis" (2018+).

## Directory Structure

- data: contains real genomics data for iPCA simulations
- functions: contains functions to perform iPCA and other existing data integration methods
- sims: contains files to run the simulations from the iPCA paper

## Usage

1. Download repository
2. Run example usage script: runiPCA.R
